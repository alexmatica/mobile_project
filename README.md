# MY IDEA
  An application for people who enjoy travelling (like I do). The application will allow the user to keep track of all his/hers travelling destinations. Possible features (that I'm thinking of):
- see a list of possible destinations
- a chart / graph of the most visited places with their number of visitors (in total, in one year, etc..)
- it will give the user information about the costs of the trip
- save favourite destinations / make a 'wishlist' of destinations / save visited destinations 
- rate and comment about visited destination; rating and comments shall be public so they could help other users
- display a map showing the route towards the destination (may be the user will be offered multiple choices for the road between the departure point and the destination, so he can choose the one he likes the most)
- receive e-mails about top destinations and reminders for the user's upcoming travelling plans
